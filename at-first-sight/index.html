Once we saw the inside, the potential was obvious, hiding behind a lot of necessary renovation work. We visited again (and again). The task was clearly pretty enormous, but the possibilities were so tantalising, that we couldn't get it off our minds.</p><p>There were definitely much more rational house-buying options, but probably none as potentially spectacular as this one. Of course, none as potentially catastrophic, either. </p><p>The auction was scheduled for March. As the auctioneer called for an opening bid, we looked around nervously. We waited. We looked at each other. Finally, we raised a head. We were the only bidders. We won. We were on our way.</p><p> </p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__footer__col"></div></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright Moandji Ezana 2018</div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.min.js" integrity="sha256-hwg4gsxgFZhOsEEamdOYGBf13FyQuiTwlAQgxVSNgt4=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script defer="defer" src="https://mwanji.github.io/lapastorie.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f503b0ac46db9f99180b3b9f932c7f9a"></script></body></html>
