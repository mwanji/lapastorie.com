We moved the tub below the window instead of along the wall. We banished the toilet to the shower room across the hall (there's something about staring into a toilet bowl that just isn't conducive to a relaxing bath).</p>\n<p>After sanding the floors, we had a good base.</p>\n<p><img class=\"post__image--center\" src=\"https://www.lapastorie.com/media/posts/2/20180611_165754_small.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"810\" height=\"1080\"></p>\n<p>In April 2017, we had driven to <a href=\"http://www.oudebouwmaterialen.nl/\">Oude Bouwmaterialen</a> in Eemnes, The Netherlands. Amongst their extensive collection of stuff recovered from houses, castles and hospitals around Europe, we found these cement tiles that came from a house somewhere in France. Or maybe from a castle. But probably from a barn.</p>\n<p><img class=\"post__image--center\" src=\"https://www.lapastorie.com/media/posts/2/20180414_145109_small.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1080\" height=\"810\"></p>\n<p>Almost immediately, we knew that these would be the bathroom's main feature. Little did we know that over a year would elapse between that Dutch road trip and the tiles being placed.</p>\n<p>One thing we learned is that knowing how to set tiles and making pleasing aesthetic choices are two different skill sets. After an initial tiling attempt, we spent a few hours placing each and every single tile. Still not perfect, perhaps, but a lot closer to it.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://www.lapastorie.com/media/posts/2/gallery/20180626_093625.jpg\" data-size=\"810x1080\"><img src=\"https://www.lapastorie.com/media/posts/2/gallery/20180626_093625-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"240\" height=\"240\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://www.lapastorie.com/media/posts/2/gallery/20180626_102548.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x3024\"><img src=\"https://www.lapastorie.com/media/posts/2/gallery/20180626_102548-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"240\" height=\"240\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://www.lapastorie.com/media/posts/2/gallery/20180628_084439.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x3024\"><img src=\"https://www.lapastorie.com/media/posts/2/gallery/20180628_084439-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"240\" height=\"240\"></a></figure>\n</div>\n<p>We think it ended up coming together nicely.

Once we saw the inside, the potential was obvious, hiding behind a lot of necessary renovation work. We visited again (and again). The task was clearly pretty enormous, but the possibilities were so tantalising, that we couldn't get it off our minds.</p>\n<p><img class=\"post__image--center\" src=\"https://www.lapastorie.com/media/posts/1/DSC_4150.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"1080\" height=\"720\"></p>\n<p>There were definitely much more rational house-buying options, but probably none as potentially spectacular as this one. Of course, none as potentially catastrophic, either. </p>\n<p>The auction was scheduled for March. As the auctioneer called for an opening bid, we looked around nervously. We waited. We looked at each other. Finally, we raised a hand. We were the only bidders. We won.
