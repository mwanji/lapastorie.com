                <p>The bathroom was in the same wonderful state as everything else:</p>
<p><img class="post__image--center" src="https://mwanji.github.io/lapastorie.com/media/posts/2/DSC_4183_small.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="1080"></p>
<p>While elsewhere we attempted to preserve or recover as much as possible, the bathroom was a complete tabula rasa:</p>

<p>Once the window had been replaced, we rethought the layout. We moved the tub below the window instead of along the wall. We banished the toilet to the shower room across the hall (there's something about staring into a toilet bowl that just isn't conducive to a relaxing bath).</p>
<p>After sanding the floors, we had a good base.</p>

<p>In April 2017, we had driven to <a href="http://www.oudebouwmaterialen.nl/">Oude Bouwmaterialen</a> in Eemnes, The Netherlands. Amongst their extensive collection of stuff recovered from houses, castles and hospitals around Europe, we found these cement tiles that came from a house somewhere in France. Or maybe from a castle. But probably from a barn.</p>

<p>Almost immediately, we knew that these would be the bathroom's main feature. Little did we know that over a year would elapse between that Dutch road trip and the tiles being placed.</p>
<p>One thing we learned is that knowing how to set tiles and making pleasing aesthetic choices are two different skill sets. After an initial tiling attempt, we spent a few hours placing each and every single tile. Still not perfect, perhaps, but a lot closer to it.</p>

<p>We think it ended up coming together nicely. Hopefully the gold-ish taps aren't too gaudy.</p>

                <p>The presbytery of the Sint Benedictus church in Mortsel had been abandoned for years. Once we heard there was a chance it would be sold, we knew we had to at least visit it.</p>
<p>The visiting period opened in February 2017. Once we saw the inside, the potential was obvious, hiding behind a lot of necessary renovation work. We visited again (and again). The task was clearly pretty enormous, but the possibilities were so tantalising, that we couldn't get it off our minds.</p>

<p>There were definitely much more rational house-buying options, but probably none as potentially spectacular as this one. Of course, none as potentially catastrophic, either. </p>
<p>The auction was scheduled for March. As the auctioneer called for an opening bid, we looked around nervously. We waited. We looked at each other. Finally, we raised a hand. We were the only bidders. We won. We were on our way.</p>
