                <p>The presbytery of the Sint Benedictus church in Mortsel had been abandoned for years. Once we heard there was a chance it would be sold, we knew we had to at least visit it.</p>
<p>The visiting period opened in February 2017. Once we saw the inside, the potential was obvious, hiding behind a lot of necessary renovation work. We visited again (and again). The task was clearly pretty enormous, but the possibilities were so tantalising, that we couldn't get it off our minds.</p>
<p>There were definitely much more rational house-buying options, but probably none as potentially spectacular as this one. Of course, none as potentially catastrophic, either. </p>
<p>The auction was scheduled for March. As the auctioneer called for an opening bid, we looked around nervously. We waited. We looked at each other. Finally, we raised a hand. We were the only bidders. We won. We were on our way.</p>
